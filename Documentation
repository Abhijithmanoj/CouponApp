Unimplemented Cases:
1. A tiered dicount system can be implemented so instead of giving a price cap for each coupon a tiered discount coupon coupon can be used  .
Example: If the total value exceeds 100, offer a 5% discount, and if it exceeds 500, offer a 10% discount. This could encourage users to buy more products to reach the next discount threshold.
2.Gift Coupon can be implemented:  Offer a free item based on the total value of the cart or specific product purchases 
3.A user entity can be implemented , so based on the previous hopping history , many coupon logic can be implemnted
Combining coupons : Applying more than one coupon based on the cart specifications.
Error handling needs to be done.

Limitations:
Current system is not using an external database, so the data is temporary
Validations are not set in craetion of coupons and  for applying
No date constarints as of now so there wont be any expiry logic for coupons
Error handling has to be done 

Assumptions:
The Request will be in correct format for all the cases as there is no validations done
